## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to create a basic statistical analysis of the temperature in Oahu during the months of June and December to determine whether or not Oahu is a good place for a surf and ice cream shop. 

The weather information was gathered and stored at a SQLite database and Python was used to query the temperatures data for the months of June and December. The output was average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. 

## Results
### June Temperature Analysis
Based on the analysis results, there was 1,700 observations for June between 2010 and 2017. Below is the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures. The low standard deviation shows a small spread across the temperature observations, meaning the temperature doesn't fluctuate significantly in June.

###  December Temperature Analysis
Based on the analysis results, there was 1,517 observations for December between 2010 and 2016. Below is the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures. Comparing June and July data we can observe that the temperatures and standard deviation are fairly close.

### Main Takeaways of Temperature Analysis
1- The average temperature in June is 74F while in December is 71F
2- The minimum temperature in June is 64F while in December is 56F
3- The maximum temperature in June is 85F while in December is 83F

## Summary:
After comparing the statistic summary of June and December we can conclude that temperatures are steady throughout the year, with small variation between Summer and Winter. With that said, Oahu would be a good place for a surf and ice cream shop.

To get a deeper understanding of the weather on Oahu we looked at a statistic summary of the precipitation for June and December, the results are below.

### Main Takeaways of Precipitation Analysis
1- The average precipitation in June is 0.13 while in December is 0.21
2- In 50% of the days the precipitation in June is less than 0.02 while in December is 0.03
3- The maximum precipitation in June is 4.43 while in December is 6.42
